/**
 * An ATN transition between any two ATN states.  Subclasses define
 * atom, set, epsilon, action, predicate, rule transitions.
 *
 * This is a one way link.  It emanates from a state (usually via a list of
 * transitions) and has a target state.
 *
 * Since we never have to change the ATN transitions once we construct it,
 * we can fix these transitions as specific classes. The DFA transitions
 * on the other hand need to update the labels as it adds transitions to
 * the states. We'll use the term Edge for the DFA to distinguish them from
 * ATN transitions.
